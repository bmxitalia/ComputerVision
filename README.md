# Computer Vision

This repository contains the work I've done for the Computer Vision course of the University of Helsinki.

In the \lectures folder there is the material the professor used to teach the course content. In this folder it's possible to find material about the following topics:

1. Introduction to Computer Vision: Basics of image understanding;
2. Transformations, projections, vanishing points and lines, camera matrix and parameters;
3. Fitering (point and neighbourhood processing), convolution, box and gaussian filters, Fourier transformation;
4. Feature detection (Harris), feature description (SIFT), feature matching, edge and line detection (hough transform);
5. Homography, RANSAC;
6. Camera calibration, triangulation, reconstruction (epipolar geometry);
7. Essential and fundamental matrices, stereo vision;
8. Optical flow (Lucas-Kanade, Horn-Schunck);
9. Image alignment and panorama stitch;
10. Structure from motion, bundle adjustment;
11. SLAM (feature based and direct visual SLAM);
12. Object recognition;
13. Convolutional neural networks.

In the \homework folder is possible to find the six homework I've done during the course. In every folder there are the exercise instructions, some MATLAB files and a report containing my solution. The exercises have been done on the following topics:

1. Linear algebra and some basics of images;
2. Image filtering, feature detection and matching, Fourier transformation;
3. Camera calibration, lines detection with handmade hough transform implementation, vanishing points computation;
4. Fundamental and Essential matrix computation using normalized 8-point algorithm, radial distortion correction;
5. Panorama stitching, Lucas-Kanade optical flow handmade implementation;
6. Group work about Generative Adversarial Netoworks.
